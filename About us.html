	<h1>About us</h1>
	<p>I created this meaningless page because I really want to test out hosting a frontend on github. The designs are not really my real designs, it's just a few minutes quick rush to quickly learn how to host my website on github for free. That's all, thanks for reading. Thanks for being interested, thank you.</p>
